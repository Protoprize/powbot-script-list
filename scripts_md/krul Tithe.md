**Does the Tithe Farming mini-game in Zeah.**
<br>

## Instructions

- **Make sure to have enough Watering Cans to water a complete growth cycle without having to refill + one extra cycle**
    - This means that for 18 patches you need 9 cans
    - 18 (patches) * 3 (cycles) + 18 (extra cycle) = 72 water portions
    - 8 portions per can means 72 / 8 => 9 Watering Cans
    - Just have 20 Watering cans to be sure...
- **Have single-tap disabled**
- **If you set `Patches` to 16, it will do 17 the first 4 rounds**
- **Make sure to close all interfaces other than Inventory**
    - Chat & the interfaces on the left of the screen have to be closed for this script to properly work.

## Features
