A great way to train raine without any HP XP gained.

Perfect for training pures to keep your combat level as low as possible!

On top of that, you can also make some side money with the archery tickets, while it's only approx 50k an hour, it's better than a loss. You never know, that 51k an hour might be enough to get you your first pk'ing supplies!

All you need is some cash and a bow, either long or short bow will do. The cash is to start the minigame and buy the arrows from the tutor (200gp per game).
